bug: town magnetic storms seem to periodically freeze sparky's bot animation.
check for RNG issue? (number of calls equal period?)
check if DOS and Apple ports have same bug.

first sound effect doesnt play?
can we buffer sfx that came just prior to audio unblock

compare teleporter sound to apple version

add url fragment shortcuts for main menu items?
the main menu rows could be normal hyperlinks

can we have a one-page about/controls screen?
- port-specific controls tutorial

bug: when file import fails (for ex, non-secure context) there is no modal, the "Processing selected files..." stays up until dismissed manually.

fix keyboard mapper so it's possible to type in lowercase on chip documentation page

need unit testing!

cross browser testing!

add custom characters to the web font, beyond the ones in the original game font:
- full-screen icon
- arrow key icons (fast and slow versions)
- fractions (for speed control)

size profiling

cpu efficiency for rgba draw layer?
- defer high-res render?

avoid canvas readback, to fix Tor browser
- i think it'd be worth including a small png library in the wasm.
- this could be used to load palettes from PNG without going through canvas, fixing the tor browser bug
- also could be used to implement an engine function to save thumbnails directly to PNG. would fix another tor browser bug, plus allow performance improvements for all browsers
- could go further and move screenshot rendering to a worker thread, instead of rate-limited rendering in the main loop

allow setting a custom palette (stored in indexeddb or settings)

feature requrests for file manager ui:
- needs support for keyboard and gamepad/joystick navigation! most of the game is playable with an xbox 360 controller, but the file modal requires mouse or touch.
- view more details about saved games. the browser could include thumbnails of robot interior, information about in-game items.
- rename and delete files
- export individual files

additional ui:
- import / export palette
- remap controller / keyboard buttons

draw bug: sprites clip against the top of screen, but in the original game sprites never clip. fix this or leave it?

can we automatically test compatibility with dos version?

fix game bugs?:

- is the "chip too complex" message broken? overcomplicated chips will usually crash the game.

port robotropolis preview from apple?

built-in editor?

mod / user-script / add-on loader?

fix tutorial bugs?:

can't recharge dead robot in tut3. battery discharged but crystals wont recharge it
- only affects tut3.
- same as dos port
- in 2.0 for Apple? no! drain and recharge work there.
- anatomy tut1, charging works. crystal F7 does charge sparky, checkers.
- wiring tut2, no crystal
- sensors tut3, has bug. crystals F7, F8, F9. fails to charge sparky, scanner, checkers.
- toolkit tut4, charging works
- circuits tut5, charging works
- teamwork tut6, charging works
- chips tut7, charging works

corruption after loading a chip: chip design tut7
- same as dos port

is there a way to have sbt86 separate the common engine code from the level-specific logic, to bring the tutorial/lab/game into the same engine?
